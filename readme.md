# GeneticTea

## What?

GeneticTea is a python script that reproduces the evolutionary model to generate
the optimal cup of tea. It's completely based on a python script with the same name
developed by ollybritton. This is a link to the original [GeneticTea](https://github.com/ollybritton/GeneticTea) script.

I express my gratitud towards **ollybritton** for developing such a wonderful script and also making it public here on GitHub for all of us to see, learn from and modifiy.

## What's new about it?

The original GeneticTea implemented the evolutionary model by perfectly reproducing nearly all
its conditions. I found, nevertheless, that one of them was missing: the exchange of genes 
between an individual (a cup of tea) and another to produce offspring of the next generation. 
Instead, the original program only mutated by a small factor the better cup of teas and removed the less
adapted ones. In other words, chromosomatic exchange and actual reproduction were not occuring.
Both this things are now implemented.

Also some attributes of the teas were added while others were removed. Teas no longer
have milkiness, are now composed by three ingredients (apart of the obvious sack of tea),
and each ingredient is defined with its own ammount. This will produce more complex and
flavorful teas!

## How to

To run the program, download the repo and `cd` into it. Then run the command:

    python3 natural_selection.py

## How it works

Each tea contains a chromosome, which is a set of genes. This set of genes
define the sweetness, brewing time and ingredients of the tea. A chromosome
is defined in the following format:

    {
      0: first ingredient of the tea,
      1: second ingredient of the tea,
      2: third ingredient of the tea,
      3: amount of the first ingredient,
      4: amount of the second ingredient,
      5: amouunt of the third ingredient,
      6: sweetness of the tea,
      7: brew time of the tea
     }



where each key is a gen and each value what it defines. All of this
values, except the ingredients, are numbers from 0.1 to 1, where 1 is "very" or
"a lot of" and 0.1 is "a little bit of" or "just a little of". 0.5 is
"a regular ammount". For instance,

    4: 0.2
    5: 0.9
    6: 0.5

defines a tea with a bit of the second ingredient, a lot of the third ingredient
and just the regular ammount of sweetness. This relative values were used because to
create an absolutely optimal cup of tea -i.e. a cup of tea whose perfection is objective-
is impossible, since taste is subjective and different for each individual. Thus,
on the sweetness gen, 0.5 is what I consider the fair, well-balanced ammount of sugar,
which is two spoonfuls. But for another man 0.5 may be four drops of sweetener, or whatever
he considers to be a well-balanced, adjusted level of sweet. Because of this, the attributes
of the teas are not objective values, but subjective considerations which should be thought
about before attempting to brew our optimal tea. If, for example, ammounts where to be
objective, and 

    0.5 = two spoonfuls, 0.1 = one spoonful and 1 = four spoonfuls

and I received the recipe for a tea which contains the following ammounts: 

    1, 1, 1, 

for ginger, garlic and sugar, I think we all would agree that such a tea would be disgusting!
If we, on the contrary, understood these values relatively as "more than what I usually use", 
or "more than what I consider balanced", I in my case would define them as two little bits of garlic
(since one is what I would consider balanced), three little bits of ginger and three
spoonfuls of sugar, which is a better-balanced, yet still restrained to the evolutionary 
model -i.e. defined by the randomness of nature and not by my taste and desire-, cup of tea.

Now, firstly, when we run the program, an initial set of teas (the initial population) is generated, each tea
with randomly casted chromosomes and thus different ingredients and qualities.
After trying the teas, you are to rank them from 0 to 9, where 0 is disgusting
and 9 is perfect. You are to input each value separated by a comma,

    n,m,x,y...

where the first value corresponds to the first tea, the second value to the second
tea, and so on.

After the initial population was ranked by you, the 5 superior teas will
reproduce between themselves, crossing their genes randomly with one another,
thus producing an offspring. This offspring passes also through a very minor
mutation process which is likely to change some of its values. When this is over,
you'll be showned the offspring as a new set of teas. This second generation
will pass through the same process: ranking, crossover and mutation, to produce
a new generation, until this repeating process boils down to one optimal cup
of tea.

As it was proven years ago, genetic mutation -and this, though can be explained
through natural selection itself at a minor scale, is a wonder of nature-
is very likely to happen on those genes that define aspects of the specimen
that are not crucial to life, but very unlikely for those that are decisive to it.
For example, we find a wide variety of hair colors and hair colors, but very similar,
nearly identical hearts and lungs. This is reproduced in the program. Those crucial
factors of our teas, which I consider to be their ingredients, can mutate,
though it's very unlikely for that to happen; while the ammount of each ingredient or the sweetness 
of the tea are much more likely to change.

The process is slow because it requires a human to taste the teas in order to
rank them, i.e. it is not capable of recognizing the fitness of an individual
of the population by itself. Nevertheless, depending on how many teas per day
you drink, you can easily reach the optimal tea in a week or two.

(To my own suprise and everyone else's, I found a use for that year I studied
anthropology in college!)
